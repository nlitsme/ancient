Schematics from an old dutch magazine: 'Computer Bulletin Special':

 * [PC-100A Schematic](pc100a-schematic.jpg) - the TI-59 thermal printer
 * [TI-59 Schematic](ti59-schematic.jpg) - the texas instruments calculator

Note that in the PC-100C, the powersupply is slightly different.
It uses either an ua79gu1c or lm337 negative voltage regulator, instead of
the transistors.

### troubleshooting

Once I accidentally powered my printer with 220V instead of the required 110V.
Causing some discomforting noises from the printer followed by a pop, when the fuse
blew. An investigation showed that the zener following the voltage regulater
had melted into a short. Replacing it with another one fixed the printer.
